Entry for the 2018 js13kgames competion.

# Description
How long can you survive in this tube shooter when your weapons are offline?

Super++ Section is an incremental tube shooter inspired by Super Hexagon and Internal Section. You fly a ship towards a never-ending horizon, constantly dodging obstacles in your path. Each run earns you points, which can be spent to buy upgrades.

# Controls
Gamepad is the preferred control scheme. Just point your joystick where you want to go, and your ship will take the shortest path to get there. You can also try to lead the joystick a little ahead of ship for fine control.

If using keyboard, press [a] to move clockwise, and [d] to move counterclockwise.
